      WELCOME TO RADMC-3D: A 3-D CONTINUUM AND LINE RT SOLVER    
                                                                 
        This is the 3-D reincarnation of the 2-D RADMC code      
                (c) 2010/2015 Cornelis Dullemond                 
                                                                 
 ************* NOTE: THIS IS STILL A BETA VERSION ***************
 ****** Some modes/capabilities are not yet ready/mature ********
                                                                 
       Please feel free to ask questions. Also please report     
        bugs and/or suspicious behavior without hestitation.     
      The reliability of this code depends on your vigilance!

 Note: T_gas taken to be equal to T_dust of dust species            1
 Reading global frequencies/wavelengths...
 Reading grid file and prepare grid tree...
    Adjusting theta(ny+1) to exactly pi/2...
    Adjusting phi(nz+1) to exactly 2*pi...
 Reading star data...
 Note: Please be aware that you treat the star(s) as
       point source(s) while using spherical coordinate mode.
       Since R_*<<R_in this is probably OK, but if you want
       to play safe, then set istar_sphere = 1 in radmc3d.inp.
 Note: Star 1 is taken to be a blackbody star
       at a temperature T = 17. Kelvin
 Grid information (current status):
   We have 1040000 branches, of which 1040000 are actual grid cells.
   ---> 100.000% mem use for branches, and 100.000% mem use for actual cells.
   No grid refinement is active. The AMR tree is not allocated (this saves memory).
 ALWAYS SELF-CHECK FOR NOW...
 Using mirror symmetry in equatorial plane, because max(theta)==pi/2.
 Waiting for commands via standard input....
 OK, received commands via standard input, now go to work.
 Starting procedure for rendering image...
   --> Including dust
       No lines included...
       No gas continuum included...
 Reading dust data...
 Note: Opacity file dustkappa_silicate.inp does not cover the 
       complete wavelength range of the model (i.e. the range
       in the file frequency.inp or wavelength_micron.inp).
       Range of model:     lambda = [ 0.10E+00, 0.10E+05]
       Range in this file: lambda = [ 0.10E+00, 0.10E+05]
       Simple extrapolations are used to extend this range.
 Reading dust densities...
 Dust mass total =    1.7760667623681906E-004  Msun
 Reading dust temperatures...
 Setting up the vertices (cell corners) for second order transfer...
 Rendering image(s)...
 Ray-tracing image for lambda =    838.07999999999993       micron...
 Used scattering_mode=0, meaning: no scattering.
 Diagnostics of flux-conservation (sub-pixeling):
     Nr of main pixels (nx*ny)   =        10000
     Nr of (sub)pixels raytraced =        91568
     Nr of (sub)pixels used      =        71176
     Increase of raytracing cost =    9.1568000000000005     
 Waiting for commands via standard input....
 OK, received commands via standard input, now go to work.
 Writing image to standard output...
