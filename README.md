"How good is dust emission as a tracer of structure of star-forming regions in molecular clouds?"
================================================================================

Project Overview
----------------

This project probes the structure of star forming regions in molecular clouds
by using dust emission as a tracer.

This repository contains all code (written exclusively in Python) pertaining to
the project. At present, the only specialist package used is RADMC-3D, a raytracing
radiative transfer code.
